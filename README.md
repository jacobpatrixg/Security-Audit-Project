A security audit and risk assessment conducted as part of the Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate
# Internal Security Audit: Botium Toys (Case Study)

## Project Overview
This project involved conducting a comprehensive security audit of Botium Toys' internal systems. The audit was designed to evaluate the organization's current security posture against the **NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)** and identify critical gaps in data protection and access control.

## Audit Scope & Objectives
* **Scope:** Internal departmental servers, cardholder data environments, and customer PII/SPII storage.
* **Objective:** Ensure compliance with industry standards and mitigate risks associated with unauthorized access and data loss.

## Strategic Recommendations
Based on the audit findings, the following controls were recommended for immediate implementation:

### 1. Access Control & Governance
* **Least Privilege & Separation of Duties:** Restrict access to sensitive data (PII/SPII and cardholder info) to only essential personnel.
* **Password Policy:** Enforce a minimum 8-character complexity requirement (alphanumeric + special characters) via a **Centralized Password Management System**.

### 2. Data Security & Technical Controls
* **Encryption & Detection:** Implement end-to-end encryption for stored data and deploy an **Intrusion Detection System (IDS)** to monitor for malicious activity.
* **Legacy Systems:** Establish an ongoing management and patching lifecycle for older hardware/software to prevent exploitation.

### 3. Continuity & Resilience
* **Disaster Recovery:** Develop a formal recovery plan and execute immediate backups of all mission-critical data to ensure business continuity.

## Skills Demonstrated
* Risk Assessment & Mitigation
* NIST CSF Alignment
* Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC)
* Security Policy Drafting
